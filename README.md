### ï»¿Data Cleaning or Preparation
1. In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
2. Data loading and inspection.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with
1. question 1
   ```sql
   select * from table1
   ```
3. question 2

### Result or Findings
1. The analysis results are summarized as follows:
2. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
3. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations
1. Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
2. Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue. Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
3. Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue
